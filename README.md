Form interface for virtual-dom

### WORK IN PROGRESS

The intention is for this to be a set of form node utility functions that will
allow us to patch properties to behave how we expect. This is probably better
than trying to implement a VNode transform: it's always better to create the
thing you wanted in the first place.

This is very early, doesn't work, no tests. I'm working in the open here.
However I am closely following the MDN docs and expect to document all of the
considered properties.
